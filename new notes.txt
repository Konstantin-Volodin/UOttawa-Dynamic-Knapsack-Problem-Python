try interior points - barrier algorithm
try feasible solution only
consider a gap in the sub problem 


maybe compute canada as well

there is a person teaching tutorials regarding compute canada at uottawa

1) try parameters
	- interior point
	- relax feasibility in subproblem
2) 
3) try simulation to generate ~10000 - ~20000 using myopic  
4) compute canada
5) try JPs

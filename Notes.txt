- try an m of 10
- try a cheap rescheduling (maybe that could change the behaviour)
- make it so complexity and priority change in different periods
	- in order to assess impact of each 




DIFFERENT COSTS PARAMETERS LEAD TO DIFFERENT MODEL PERFORMANCE
	- higher cost of rescheduling and unit violation - results in MDP performing worse
	- lower cost - MDP performs better - does that even make sense??



STUFF TO DO (2023-04-01)




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE WAY MODEL IS FORMULATED M HAS TO BE max(TL)+1
	- because the way it is formulated - patients will always be assumed to transition starting on second last wait list

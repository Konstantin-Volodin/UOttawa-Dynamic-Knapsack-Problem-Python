meeting with stephen
	- not sure how relevant complexities are
	- there is not a lot of that happening
		- the time horizon might be a longer horizon
	- he has a comment for the literature, have to make sure it doesn't have any factors someone might disagree with 
		(not used to looking at theoretical works)
		- and the main issue could be the transition rates - it is much lower than actually assumed
	- can introduce prioritazation of patients


	Next Steps:
		1) Implement/Solve fully
		2) Develop a case for a model
		3) Write the model to journal

	Questions:
		- PPE is shared but some resources might not be shared between CPUs
		- Maybe longer period of time - maybe month instead of week
		- Deterioration is about 3-6 month
		- Do we need to introduce priorities
			- Quality based procedures?
			- To make the model more realistic - it would be better to add priorities

	Comments:
		- Maybe initial case would be just for a single doctor - Stephen

Meeting with Wojtek/Antoine	
	1) Need to consider prioritization
		- easy - just one index
	2) Differentiating between CPUs
		- Add OR time - usually very rigid
		- don't need to differentiate between CPU specific resources, because we are only looking at 1 CPU
	3) Case Study
		- Stephen's practice

	maybe we should focus the model on spine specifically
	we have a simulation resources that simulates distribution between CPUs
	TL is 6 weeks
	
	- the goal is to put it into a spine journal
	- add more resources in addition to PPE
		- OR time 
	- Need differentiation by surgery type
		- Change CPU to surgery type (since we are only focusing on spine)


Meetning with Antoine - Wojtek
	a) OR Time - assume fixed for now - keep fixed
	b) Staffing - suggests we use 1 type for now - assume it is fixed - keep 1 fixed
	c) ppe - good to have for political reasons (these 4) - start with 1 - start with 1
	d) instrumentation - issue if it is not available - is it really a constraint?  - maybe not?
		- is it really necessary?
	e) Same as ^ for bone grafts - maybe not necessary
	f) Same as staff - should be available - same as PPE
	g) ignore medication - ignore
	h) ignore

keep 3 surgeries 
	- up to 2 hours
	- 3-4 hours
	- over 4 hours


Meeting with Antoine - Wojtek about Steve's ideas
	1) Complexity discussion
		- A surgery can become more complex, by requiring more time
		- Some evolve, some don't
		- It only affects time really
	2) Items to include (resources)
		- Steve is saying we should consider everything - but it is not possible
		- For proof of concept - include a couple of items from big categories
			- PPE
				- Mask and Gloves
			- Instrumentation
				- Convert everything into money
			- OR Time
			- Bed Days?
				- patients will need to stay for a number of days
				- this will be the resource that changes the most with complexity
	3) Group surgeties into 3 categories
		- 

	4 Distinct Resources
	3 Surgery types
		- a/b
		- f/h
		- d/e

Meeting with Antoine - 2021/04/30
	move uv to action
	add resource carry over to simulation
	- Equation (10) - we assume if we used too much resource it comes out of next period
		- that is you can use tomorrow's resources for high cost 
	- add post decision auxiliary variable
	

Meeting with Wojtek and Antoine - 2021/05/07
	transition state - instead of the post-transition state
	non-carry over resource - rename it to perishable resource


look into deviation - why did it make it work ?????
	- why making a small change makes the model works??
	- sensitivity analysis with low deviation

- remove good scheduleds
- make rescheduling cost prohibitively high
	- see what happens


Antoine's Comments on mathematical model:
	- Assumption number 2 - first point there is a penalty
	- Bad reschedules - from period 1 to any period
	- expected units state
		- is it a state or a parameter input
		- 
	- we can remove ue and uu
		- and change uv to left over and violation
		- and change it to left over in order to keep any left over information
	- make uv only incur cost on day 1 
		- if we do that, it would allow people to be scheduled however the model wants without considering the violation
	- for custom bounds on reschedules change t=t' to t = t' = 1
	- pw bound change last T to something higher
	- units left over bound is twice - try that or maybe increase it higher later
- TODO:
	- implement the changes that we discussed
	- try it out 
	- and look for bugs



- to discuss:
	1) new model changes
	2) difference between close to optimal and completely optimal
		- and the method for generation the completely optimal
		- including the bologna site: https://www.gerad.ca/colloques/ColumnGeneration2008/slides/EduardoU.pdf
	- It appears that the model when it is  very close to optimality - E-17 but its not
		- it gets stuck with the same value for a while
		- however when a large number of columns gets removed (because they are not used in the master problem)
		it is sometimes able to reach optimality of 0 reduced cost
			- I will show the two excel files highlighting the differences
	- And also the method linked above - it tries to speed up column generation by stabilizing it
		- it has initial beta and then does the expoinential smoothing on it with new beta values
		- I would like to discuss how the gap is calculated and if this method actually helps 
		- I found it doesn't help much for speed - is it an error
	3) Discuss how ps 0 is never present and patients scheduled 0 is also never included
		- maybe that would mean some betas have to be negative??
	4) Also it sometimes doesn't reach optimal answer at all - when expected value of ul is 0


Notes - set the waiting cost to start at max scheduling cost

- priority appears to be different from complexity 
we will come up in english of what the model does

try to solve on the university computers
revised model to show to stephen - 
	- make sure to show the assumptions well
	- show pictures from the model to show that it is serious!
	- 

- interier point solution for subproblem
- instead of reformulating - update subproblem
- que jumping - going from one priority to the next

- provide main things
- provide a timeline

 - ask IT for METlab computers IP

Ahmet could know more about DEA

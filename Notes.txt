- try an m of 10
- try a cheap rescheduling (maybe that could change the behaviour)
- make it so complexity and priority change in different periods
	- in order to assess impact of each 

maybe compute canada as well
there is a person teaching tutorials regarding compute canada at uottawa

1) try parameters
	- Performed GUROBI Tune
		- ~2% improvement?
	- interior point
		- Interior point seems to make no difference		
	- relax feasibility in subproblem
		speeds up iterations, but improves bound slower
		- need to compare how long to reach ceraint bound for 2 methods
3) try simulation to generate ~10000 - ~20000 using myopic  
	- todo
4) compute canada
	- waiting on account
5) try MET servers
	- done



DIFFERENT COSTS PARAMETERS LEAD TO DIFFERENT MODEL PERFORMANCE
	- higher cost of rescheduling and unit violation - results in MDP performing worse
	- lower cost - MDP performs better - does that even make sense??

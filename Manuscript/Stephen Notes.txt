meeting with stephen
	- not sure how relevant complexities are
	- there is not a lot of that happening
		- the time horizon might be a longer horizon
	- he has a comment for the literature, have to make sure it doesn't have any factors someone might disagree with 
		(not used to looking at theoretical works)
		- and the main issue could be the transition rates - it is much lower than actually assumed
	- can introduce prioritazation of patients


Next Steps:
	1) Implement/Solve fully
	2) Develop a case for a model
	3) Write the model to journal

Questions:
	- PPE is shared but some resources might not be shared between CPUs
	- Maybe longer period of time - maybe month instead of week
	- Deterioration is about 3-6 month
	- Do we need to introduce priorities
		- Quality based procedures?
		- To make the model more realistic - it would be better to add priorities

Comments:
	- Maybe initial case would be just for a single doctor - Stephen

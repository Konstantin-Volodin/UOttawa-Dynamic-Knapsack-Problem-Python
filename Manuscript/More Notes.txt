1) Need to consider prioritization
	- easy - just one index
2) Differentiating between CPUs
	- Add OR time - usually very rigid
	- don't need to differentiate between CPU specific resources, because we are only looking at 1 CPU
3) Case Study
	- Stephen's practice

maybe we should focus the model on spine specifically
we have a simulation resources that simulates distribution between CPUs

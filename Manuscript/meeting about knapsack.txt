fuzzy set theory - fuzzy numbers
add rescheduling - add variability in number of units
number of units used not stochastic

- Change consistency equation - need to add complexity 
	- curernt waiting - booked + who become worse
	- flow conservation equation

penalty for booking late in advance

have to define - 
	demand, 
	fuzzy demand,
	supply transitions
	

problems wih the model:
	- monthly - too general change to weekly
		- because monthly smoothes out variations
	- how many month we can look ahead
		3 month - 12 periods - 9 periods if model too large
	- 

fix up constraints for transition probabilities:
	- need one for each state variable
	- demand constraint what you book has to be less than or equal to the deman
rescheduling
	- potentially another variable
	- capital D number of complexities level
fuzzy number for month 1 only
expected change in utilization
costs for scheduling too late

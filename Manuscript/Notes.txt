meeting with stephen
	- not sure how relevant complexities are
	- there is not a lot of that happening
		- the time horizon might be a longer horizon
	- he has a comment for the literature, have to make sure it doesn't have any factors someone might disagree with 
		(not used to looking at theoretical works)
		- and the main issue could be the transition rates - it is much lower than actually assumed
	- can introduce prioritazation of patients


	Next Steps:
		1) Implement/Solve fully
		2) Develop a case for a model
		3) Write the model to journal

	Questions:
		- PPE is shared but some resources might not be shared between CPUs
		- Maybe longer period of time - maybe month instead of week
		- Deterioration is about 3-6 month
		- Do we need to introduce priorities
			- Quality based procedures?
			- To make the model more realistic - it would be better to add priorities

	Comments:
		- Maybe initial case would be just for a single doctor - Stephen

Meeting with Wojtek/Antoine	
	1) Need to consider prioritization
		- easy - just one index
	2) Differentiating between CPUs
		- Add OR time - usually very rigid
		- don't need to differentiate between CPU specific resources, because we are only looking at 1 CPU
	3) Case Study
		- Stephen's practice

	maybe we should focus the model on spine specifically
	we have a simulation resources that simulates distribution between CPUs
	TL is 6 weeks
	
	- the goal is to put it into a spine journal
	- add more resources in addition to PPE
		- OR time 
	- Need differentiation by surgery type
		- Change CPU to surgery type (since we are only focusing on spine)


Meetning with Antoine - Wojtek
	a) OR Time - assume fixed for now - keep fixed
	b) Staffing - suggests we use 1 type for now - assume it is fixed - keep 1 fixed
	c) ppe - good to have for political reasons (these 4) - start with 1 - start with 1
	d) instrumentation - issue if it is not available - is it really a constraint?  - maybe not?
		- is it really necessary?
	e) Same as ^ for bone grafts - maybe not necessary
	f) Same as staff - should be available - same as PPE
	g) ignore medication - ignore
	h) ignore

keep 3 surgeries 
	- up to 2 hours
	- 3-4 hours
	- over 4 hours


Meeting with Antoine - Wojtek about Steve's ideas
	1) Complexity discussion
		- A surgery can become more complex, by requiring more time
		- Some evolve, some don't
		- It only affects time really
	2) Items to include (resources)
		- Steve is saying we should consider everything - but it is not possible
		- For proof of concept - include a couple of items from big categories
			- PPE
				- Mask and Gloves
			- Instrumentation
				- Convert everything into money
			- OR Time
			- Bed Days?
				- patients will need to stay for a number of days
				- this will be the resource that changes the most with complexity
	3) Group surgeties into 3 categories
		- 

	4 Distinct Resources
	3 Surgery types
		- a/b
		- f/h
		- d/e

Meeting with Antoine - 2021/04/30
	move uv to action
	equation (1) - change to less equal sign
	add resource carry over to simulation
	- Equation (10) - we assume if we used too much resource it comes out of next period
		- that is you can use tomorrow's resources for high cost 
	- add post decision auxiliary variable
